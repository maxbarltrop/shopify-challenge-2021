Entering text into the search box will bring up a paginated list of movies. Nominate adds that movie to the nominee list, and 'Tell Me More' loads a full description of the movie below. Navigating away from the page, the nominee list is saved in local storage. When the user nominates 5 movies, a banner pops up, which will pop up again if they remove and add more again.
